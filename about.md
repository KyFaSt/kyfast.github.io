Hi there! My name is Kylie Stradley, I'm a web developer based in Atlanta, GA & a [professional nerd](http://www.bignerdranch.com/about-us/nerds/kylie-stradley.html).


I haven't always been a developer though, I started writing ruby about a year and a half ago and haven't looked back. I like working with such a practical friendly language even though I usually use it to write impractical things. Most of my blog posts & projects reflect that perspective. Read my tweets or let me know what you think [@kyfast](https://twitter.com/kyfast). Or, check out my [github profile](https://github.com/kyfast).
