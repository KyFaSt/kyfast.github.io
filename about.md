Hi there! My name is Kylie Stradley, I'm an Atlanta area web developer. I got my start at Big Nerd Ranch but now I monkey around at MailChimp.

I haven't always been a developer though, I started writing Ruby professionally in 2014 while working at Big Nerd Ranch and haven't looked back since. I like working with such a practical friendly language even though I usually use it to write impractical things. Most of my blog posts & projects reflect that perspective. You can usually find me hanging out with the [Atlanta Rails Girls](https://meetup.com/rails-girls-atlanta), TAing [Girl Develop It Classes](https://meetup.com/girl-develop-it-atlanta), co-organizing [RailsBridge Atlanta Workshops](https://www.bridgetroll.org/chapters/38), or helping facilitate [Code Retreats](http://coderetreat.org/) in Atlanta. Read my tweets or let me know what you think [@kyfast](https://twitter.com/kyfast). Or, check out my [github profile](https://github.com/kyfast)!
