In January I took a leap of faith & decided to quit my job to take a developer internship at [Big Nerd Ranch](http://www.bignerdranch.com/) in Atlanta. I've enjoyed my time there so far & I'm very pleased to report that it's as awesome as I expected.

At the beginning of my internship, I was given the opportunity to write a post for the BNR blog about taking a risk & quitting my fulltime job to become an intern. You can read my post [here](http://www.bignerdranch.com/blog/taking-risks-became-big-nerd-ranch-intern/). It was awesome to get to write about my experiences and be featured on Big Nerd Ranch's website but I'd really like to feel confident enough to write on more technical topics.
