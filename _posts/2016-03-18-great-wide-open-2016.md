### [Great Wide Open Conference 2016](http://greatwideopen.org/)

[Great Wide Open](http://greatwideopen.org/) is an open source conference dedicated to ["Access, Diversity, World-Class Content and Value"](http://greatwideopen.org/values/) so when Rails Girls Atlanta Co-Founder [Pamela O. Vickers](http://greatwideopen.org/speakers/pamela-vickers/) asked me if I wanted to give a joint presentation on the founding, maintaining and community building of the Rails Girls meetup, I jumped at the opportunity.

Great Wide Open has always been a great friend to the Atlanta tech community and to Rails Girls Atlanta. By providing a low-cost (and for scholarship reciepients, free) high-quality conference in our city they have greatly increased access to technology education and open source contribution to all Atlantans.

What you may not know is that Great Wide Open was one of the first conferences I ever attended as a developer.

At the time, everything was kind of scary because I wasn't familiar with the tech conference format but I really appreciated the steps taken to include everyone. For me, getting to come back to this conference that was so welcoming to me as I was just joining the tech industry felt amazing. I got to meet even more kind people dedicated to increasing access to open source.
