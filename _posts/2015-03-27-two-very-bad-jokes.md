Not everything on this blog will be about programming.  I really enjoy my work, but only if I need a job. If I didn't need a job, instead of writing terrible, terrible code I would write terrible, terrible comedy. Here are two very bad jokes I wrote for a very bad standup set for people who only want to hear jokes about animals:

### Cats

Cats hate the smell of citrus because it reminds them of the time that they got way too drunk on El Presidente margaritas and got banned from Chilis.

### Dogs

Dogs can't have chocolate because they're dieting.
