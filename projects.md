##[Shinding Sheriff](https://github.com/bignerdranch/shindigsheriff)

I worked on this app as part of my Big Nerd Ranch internship, I was really lucky to work with another Rails intern [Chae O'Keefe](https://github.com/chaeokay). This app is intended to help meetup organizers manage the 'assets' associated with their events, especially locations and sponsorship money. If you're looking for a beginner/intermediate rails project to make contributions on, this is it!

##[EarthSpy](http://earthspy.herokuapp.com/)

My first foray in JavaScript. I worked again with [Melissa Holmes](https://github.com/meltar), this time at Atlanta's [Space Apps](https://2014.spaceappschallenge.org/). We used JavaScript, XML & the Google Maps API to create an app to search the earth for images taken from the international space station. Our team even won "best use of data"!

##[Challenge Champion](http://challengechampion.herokuapp.com/)

Originally created for an [ATL Rails Girls](http://www.meetup.com/Rails-Girls-Atlanta/) hack night with [Melissa Holmes](https://github.com/meltar). We wanted to design an app that would utilise twitter oauth and allow users to challenge their friends to annoying challenges from the comfort of their own desk chair.</p>
