##[Challenge Champion](http://challengechampion.herokuapp.com/)

Originally created for an [ATL Rails Girls](http://www.meetup.com/Rails-Girls-Atlanta/) hack night with [Melissa Holmes](https://github.com/meltar). We wanted to design an app that would utilise twitter oauth and allow users to challenge their friends to annoying challenges from the comfort of their own desk chair.</p>
