Amelia Bedelia Learns to Code
-----------
I gave first ever conference talk at RailsConf in April 2015, I discussed errors many beginner make and why. This talk isn't just for beginners though, I hope more advanced developers will enjoy reminiscing their own mistakes and share with their junior colleagues. I wrote this talk to encourage developers to normalize making mistakes. Feel free to tell me about your beginner mistakes on [twitter](https://twitter.com/kyfast).

A Practical Taxonomy of Bugs and How to Squash Them
-----------
Catching software bugs is a mysterious magic, unknowable by science, and untouchable by process. Debugging skills are instinctual and come only from years of experience.

False! Programming bugs, like real bugs, can be organized into a deterministic taxonomy. At its base, consistent and successful debugging is pattern matching. Classifying bugs by their attributes and behaviors makes the seemingly impossible possible—codifying the elusive “programmer’s instincts” into a debugging toolkit.
